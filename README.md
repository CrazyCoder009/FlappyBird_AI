# FlappyBird_AI
A simple from scratch implementation of Feed Forward Neural Network on the famous Flappy Bird game. The network teaches itself how to play the game through simultaneous generations over a period of time. The framework used is NEAT in Python to teach the AI. 

Setup:
1. download the repo.
2. open up the directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. now run the game using python FlappyBirdGame.py

Config:
1. You can configure the Neural Net properties from the config-feedforward.txt file.(eg:- No. of neurons,population etc)


A Huge Shoutout to Tech with Tim, without whom I wouldn't have learnt how to design and make the game from scratch along with the AI behind it.
